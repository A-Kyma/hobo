=== Release 0.4.3 ===

Front-controller now filters parameter logging so that passwords are
not logged.

Check if a controller is a Hobo model-controller before installing
Hobo routes.

DRYML

  Can now use obj= and attr= on the same tag, so you can e.g.

    <edit obj="#@this" attr="name"/>

  (The alternative, <edit obj="@this.name"> would not work as
  <edit> needs this_field which would be nil)

  Shorthand obj="page" for obj="#@this"

Various fixes and enhancements to the permission system. Things are somewhat
experimental and subject to change!

Core tags/helpers

  `viewable` method filters a collection down to objects that are
  viewable.


Hobo Rapid:

  <new_in_collection_page> now includes belongs_to associations in the
  form.

  Cleanup of form field / editor tags

  <ul_for> and <table_for> now skip non-viewable objects

  Fix: even/odd cycle in table_for and ul_for was broken with nested lists/tables.

  Page navigation enhanced to allow URL query parameters to be
  maintained from page to page.

  <show_collection_page> now only includes a "New Whatever" link if
  the collection is a "simple" has_many collection (no conditions, not
  :through)

  <object_link> now has a view attribute to link to alternate views of
  the object (see below: alternate show pages)

  <object_table>

    Now allows additional rows to be added by giving a tag-body.

    skip_fields attribute to remove fields from the table

  Better support for confirmation dialogues in <delete_button>


Tabla theme:

  Increased width to 800px;

  Small style enhancements


Hobo Module

  Fix to dom_id for objects in an array that is not an AR association
  (e.g. an array returned by find(:all))

Support for alternative "show" pages. E.g. to add a "profile" page to a User, add

    show_method :profile

  To the UsersController and create
  app/views/people/profile.dryml. You also get a named route
  "user_profile" (e.g. you can call user_profile_url(fred) )

  (Using Hobo Rapid you can link to these with <object_link view="profile"/>)

Fix to template lookup for association pages (e.g. posts/12/comments
and posts/12/comments/new)

Support for permission class methods (experimental). If you can define
permission without access to the object state, you can now do so on
the class:

  def self.viewable_by(viewer, field)
    false
  end

  This helps Hobo in places where there is no object. e.g. in deciding
  whether or not to present a "New Whatsit" link

Fix: pagination was broken on index pages with data-filters.


Hobo::ModelController

  Enhanced to allow updating of date and datetime fields. Dates and
  date-times can be provided either as strings (Hobo will use Chronic
  for parsing if it's installed) or hashes with :year, :month, :day
  etc. keys (as used by the select_date helper).

  find_by_data_filter renamed to find_with_data_filter and now does a
  non-filtered find if no filters were given in the request.

  Added count_with_data_filter

  Fixes to checking create permission when the post parameters
  contains related sub-objects.

  Access to the new page is forbidden if the current user does not
  have create permission.


Hobo::Model

  New model queries <field>_starts and <field>_ends

  The <field>_is query will now use an "IS NULL" query if you pass
  nil.

  Added support for counts with queries, e.g:

    User.count { name_starts 't' }

  Calling `new` on a has_many association (e.g. post.comments.new) has
  enhanced behaviour for new records (those not in the db). Hobo will
  try to set up the reciprocal belongs_to association on the created
  object. This is needed by the permission system when testing
  can_create?

  #reverse_reflection will attempt to find the reciprocal belongs_to
  association from a has_many association.


Ajax mechanism

  Fix when using multiple instances of the same part on the same page
  (i.e. when a part_id attribute appears in a loop).

  Fix when the this_field for the part context is an array index.


Chronic fix to handle dates like "11th Jan" (it can handle "Jan 11th"
and "11 Jan" but not "11th Jan")


New feature - Integration testing DSL. Adds an easy to use DSL for
integration tests.



=== Release 0.4.2 ===

Fix in permission system



=== Release 0.4.1 ===

New feature: "web-methods" -- RPC style actions in model-controllers. Including
support for ajax responses.

New named route "home" to FrontController#index

Hobo Rapid:

  Renamed <object_small> to <object_card>

  Added support for ajax responses to web-methods

  Removed <possessive> (too app specific)

  <object_link> now passes extra options to the generated <a> tag
  (e.g. class, id)

  Extra options to <edit> are now passed on to the delegate.

  Naming of edit controls reworked. <editor> is an ajax editor,
  <form_field> is a non-ajax form field, <edit> chooses automatically
  between the two. Other tags renamed too -
  e.g. <in_place_edit_for_boolean> renamed to
  <boolean_checkbox_editor>

  Support for datetime and date selects in form fields (not editors)

  Added autosubmit option to autocompleters - submits the form as soon
  as an option is selected.

  Added confirm option to ajax_updater (wraps call in a JS confirm
  dialogue)

  More data types supported by <editor> (formerly in_place_edit)

  New tag <belongs_to_editor>. Currently just delegates to
  <belongs_to_menu_editor> but is intended to switch to an
  autocompleter if there are too many options for a menu.

  New css classes create_button, update_button, delete_button added to
  button tags.

  Image attribute for delete_button for <input type="image">
  buttons. Needs implementing on the other buttons (or maybe we should
  be using css styling only!)

  New tag: <remote_method_button>

  <object_form> updated to only add hidden tags for fields that don't
  appear in the form.

hobo_rapid.js

  Fix: in-place-edit controls were displaying the JavaScript source of
  an alert message after a validation error.

  Support for ajax responses to RPC actions.

  Fix in Hobo.ajaxRequest when no `method` option was given.

  Hobo.applyEvents can now be given an element or a DOM ID.

  Hobo.removeButton: changed duration of Fade effect

  Fix in objectElementFor

  Re-enabled applyEvents in Hobo.updateElement


Tabla theme

  Various CSS refinements

  Added account_nav attribute to <page>

  Added class attribute to page - applied to body tag

  Disable account nav if no `login_url` route exists


hobo_user_model generator

  Migration

    Changed `login` column to `username`.

    Changed to use Hobo migration syntax

  Model: Uses new `set_login_attr`


Plugin initialiser (init.rb)

  Fixed problem with ordering of requires

  Eliminated code to load all models at startup (now done on demand in Hobo module)
  This reduces the footprint of Hobo, e.g. for apps that want only DRYML.


ActiveRecord extensions

  Added HasManyAssociation#new_without_appending. Creates a model with
  the correct belongs_to association but doesn't add it to the
  array. Needed for the permission system.

  Added #member_class to HasManyAssociation and
  HasManyThroughAssociation - convenience method for
  proxy_reflection.klass


General Ruby extensions

  Renamed is_in? to in? to conform with ruby-extensions project.

  Added Module#inheriting_attr_accessor. Creates an attribute accessor
  that looks in the superclass if the attribute does not exist on
  self. Should be used on classes (e.g. inside class << self)


User Authentication

  The user model can now override the class-method
  `password_validations` to customise those.

  Virtual fields `password` and `password_confirmation` now declared
  with field type :password. Hobo Rapid will now generate
  password-edit fields for these.

  Column used for the user-name is now declared by the user-model
  class, e.g.

    class User; set_login_attr :email; end

  Extracted acts_as_authenticated controller extensions into
  Hobo::AuthenticationSupport (was in Hobo::Controller)

  Hobo will manage a last_login_at datetime if such a column exists on
  the user model.


Site-wide search

  Added message when no results found

  Remove objects from results that are not viewable by the current_user


Hobo Controller

  Fix: render_tags - hoboParts JavaScript was rendered multiple times

  Ajax mechanism updated to support RPC actions.


Core tags & DRYML helpers

  Fix: per-request cache of current_user was not working

  Fix: can_update? was broken

  Fix: can_view_this? handles non-ActiveRecord objects better

  can_view_this? delegates to can_view if this_parent or this_field
  is null (previously an error).

  Fix: tag_for_object was broken

  <show> supports more field types

  <repeat> now sets the model_id attribute on the repeated element.

  new conditions <unless_blank>, <unless_empty>, <if_can_edit>

  add_classes split into two methods, one that modifies the hash
  (add_classes!) and one that generates a new one (add_classes)

  Made the new object optional on can_update

  Added a style attribute to <human_type> can be any string method,
  e.g. pluralize, downcase etc.


DRYML

  Form fields that appear within a DRYML form context are now tracked,
  so that hidden fields can be automatically added for just those
  fields that do not appear in the form.

  Renamed instance variable to current context to @_this. Was clashing
  with @this page context.

  Fix: this_type was failing to default to this.class when using the
  obj="" attribute

  Renamed method _part_context_js to part_context_js


Model Extensions (hobo_model)

  Renamed set_fields_types to set_field_type

  Added set_search_columns declaration as a shorthand alternative to
  defining class method search_columns. e.g.

    class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
      hobo_model
      set_search_columns :content, :notes
    end

  An id_name with the :underscore option no longer returns the name
  with underscores by default. By default you get the name as it is in
  the DB, if you call id_name(true) you get it with underscores
  instead of spaces (e.g. for use in URLs).

  Added Hobo::Model.set_default_order e.g.

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      set_default_order "name"
    end 

    To use: User.find(:all, :order => :default). Default order is used
    by the hobo_model_controller

Model Controller

  Fix: show-collection action (e.g. post/12/comments) now uniquifies
  the collection if the :uniq option was given on the has_many
  declaration.

  hobo_render now allows the template to be looked for in other
  classes (e.g. in app/views/other_class)

  Added web_method declaration for RPC-style actions. e.g.

    class Users < ApplicationController
      web_method :reset_password
      def reset_password
        new_pw = @this.reset_password
        hobo_ajax_response(@this, :password => new_pw)
      end
    end

  show action now calls permission_denied unless the current user can
  view the object.

  Added customisation hooks create_response, update_response,
  destroy_response. And for invalid records: invalid_create_response,
  and invalid_update_response. The default response will only happen
  if these methods don't do a render or a redirect.

  Added before filter to prepare for a web_method

  Template lookup path changed for
  collections. e.g. /posts/12/comments will now fallback on
  app/vews/comments/show_in_collection and /posts/12/comments/12 will
  fallback on app/views/comments/new_in_collection

  index action respects the model's default_order

Model Queries

  Renamed predicate in_association to is_in

  Added predicate not_in

  Added support for model-defined predicates. Any predicate not found
  will be looked up on the model class.

Hobo module

  Removed guest_user attribute

  Hobo.models now loads all model classes on demand the first time it
  is called.

  Removed parentheses from query in find_by_search (SQLite
  compatibility)

  add_routes now adds routes for web methods

  can_create? uses new_without_appending when passed a has_many
  association to check if the user is allowed to create an object in
  that collection.

  can_edit? returns false for polymorphic associations (for now!)

  can_view? can now handle AR classes (can view instances of this
  class?)  and associations (can view items in this association?)

  Added can_call? permission method for web-methods

Added Rakefile with rdoc task
