This is a plugin for [Hobo](http://hobocentral.net) that does lots of
cool stuff.

All text before the first heading is considered the "short description" of this plugin

### Installation

It can be installed into a Hobo app by typing:

    hobo generate install_plugin <%= @filename %> git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @filename %>.git

Although if this plugin is a theme, it's better to use:

    hobo generate install_plugin <%= @filename %> git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @filename %>.git --subsite=front --css-top

If you want it installed in a different subsite, replace "front" with the subsite name.

You'll have to manually remove references to any old themes from front_site.dryml, front.js & front.css.

The source for this plugin lives at git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @filename %>.   Pull requests are welcome.

Documentation for this plugin is in the DRYMLDoc.   It will be visible on [the hobo cookbook](http://cookbook.hobocentral.net) once the author pushes it there.  Until then it may be viewed directly in the source in the taglibs directly.
