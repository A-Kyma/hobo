# <%= @plugin_name %>

This is a plugin for [Hobo](http://hobocentral.net) that does lots of
cool stuff.  It uses the MIT-LICENSE so you can use it too.

It can be installed into a Hobo app by typing:

    hobo generate install_plugin <%= @plugin_name %> git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @plugin_name %>.git

Although if this plugin is a theme, it's better to use:

    hobo generate install_plugin <%= @plugin_name %> git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @plugin_name %>.git -s front

If you want it on a different subsite, replace "front" with the subsite name.

You'll have to manually remove references to any old themes from front_site.dryml, front.js & front.css.

The source for this plugin lives at git://github.com/my_github_username/<%= @plugin_name %>.   Pull requests are welcome.
