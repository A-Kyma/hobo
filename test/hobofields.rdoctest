# HoboFields

HoboFields provides two main features:

 * An extension to ActiveRecord that provides rich field types such as "markdown text" or "email address"
 * A generator that writes your migrations for you. Your migration writing days are over.
 
This is all done using a declaration of your fields that you put in your models, for example

    class BlogPost < ActiveRecord::Base
      fields do
        title :string
        body  :text
      end
    end

Once you have declared your fields like this, you can run the following, at any time during the development of your project:

	$ ./script/generate hobo_migration
	
The migration generator will create a migration to change from the schema that is currently in your database, to the schema that your models need. That's really all there is to it. Note that the migration generator is interactive -- it can't tell the difference between renaming something vs. adding one thing and removing another, so it has to ask you.

## Migration Generator Doctests

The [migration generator doctests][migration_generator.html] provide a lot more detail, but they're not great as documentation because doctests run in a single irb session, which doesn't fit well with the concept of a generator. Skip these unless you're really keen to see how this all works.

## HoboFields API Doctests

As well as the migration generator, HoboFields provides a bunch of small extensions to ActiveRedord. The [HoboFields API doctests][hobofields_api.html] provide a useful reference to these.
