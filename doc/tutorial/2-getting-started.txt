# Getting Started

In this quick-start we'll run through the creation of the "POD" classified adverts application which was featured in the early Hobo screencasts. At the time of writing those screencasts are very out-dated, but this guide brings things up to date with Hobo 0.7.2.

For this guide we're going to assume that you're working with a text-editor and command-line terminal.
