In order to run the tests, you have to have git installed and:

  $ sudo gem install irt
  $ cd into this dir (test/irt)
  $ ./setup.rb
    or if you are testing a local repo of hobo
  $ HOBO_DEV_ROOT=~/path/to/hoborepo ./setup.rb

  $ cd testapp
  $ irt ../
    or
  $ irt ../path/to/test.irt

You can delete the testapp dir when you finish.
