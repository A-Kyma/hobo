It's quite likely that some of the new tag definitions are missing
id, class, merge or param attributes.  This doesn't impact core
functionality, but it does limit your ability to extend the tags.  If
you notice any such omissions, please let us know, it is easy to fix..

before pre1:

 * front.* etc need to be added to precompile lists or something

would be nice:

 * parametrize the clean theme
 * create a bootstrap theme
