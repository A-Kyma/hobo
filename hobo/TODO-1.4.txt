# TODO

## regressions

 * sortable-input-many does not work
 * remote-method-button, create-button, update-button,
   transition-button: normal usages of these tags work, but they do
   not work if you ask them to do AJAX
 * live-search works, but it's not 'live'.  You have to press return
   to start the search
 * the rapid_summary tags have been moved out
   of core Hobo into their own plugin,
   https://github.com/Hobo/hobo_summary, which is not yet in a working state

## documentation

 * document themes/plugins
 * FAQ
 * agility
 * admin subsite
 * books
 * ajax manual section
 * miscellaneous controller extensions
 * there's some nice stuff in HoboFields::Model that should be documented & tested

## Cookbook

 * search
 * actually use Hobo 1.4's new caching abilities
 * auto-link tags in manual
 * create fakedef manual entries for DRYML tags not in taglibs entry

## new features that aren't "done"

 * clean_sidemenu -> plugin
 * cache: csrf warning
 * monkey patch will_paginate if my patches are not upstreamed

It's quite likely that some of the new tag definitions are missing
useful id, class, merge or param attributes.  This doesn't impact core
functionality, but it does limit your ability to extend the tags.  If
you notice any such omissions, please let us know, it is easy to fix..

## stuff that we really want to do

 * multiple file support for AJAX uploads
 * cache: redis support
 * fixup deprecation warnings
 * port to Rails 3.2 and/or 4.0
 * nuke any remaining prototype code
 * add a sane default for non-AJAX JSON requests.
 * trawl the lighthouse && pull requests
 * steal the tags from Portal
 * fixup hobo-contrib
 * convert paperclip_with_hobo to gem

## would be nice:

 * parametrize the clean theme
 * create a bootstrap theme
 * add theme chooser to setup wizard
 * add support for has-one
 * convert old Hobo plugins:  imaginary-dryml, hoboyui
