# TODO

## regressions

 * after-submit is probably broken
 * remote-method-button, create-button, update-button,
   transition-button: normal usages of these tags work, but they do
   not work if you ask them to do AJAX
 * live-search works, but it's not 'live'.  You have to press return
   to start the search
 * sortable-input-many doesn't work
 * name-many doesn't work
 * remove-button, remote-method-button, create-button & update-button
   used to display inline but now display as a block.   In other
   words, they now display one per line rather than several in a
   single line.
 * the rapid_summary tags are probably broken.  They will be moved out
   of core Hobo into their own plugin

## documentation

 * document themes/plugins
 * FAQ
 * agility
 * admin subsite
 * books
 * ajax manual section

## Cookbook

 * captcha
 * search
 * actually use our Hobo 1.4's new caching abilities
 * auto-link tags in manual

## new features that aren't "done"

 * create_response: mirror update_response
 * taglib cleanup
 * clean_sidemenu -> plugin
 * nested-cache: csrf workaround
 * nested-cache: enhanced sweeper version
 * deal with my patches to will_paginate

It's quite likely that some of the new tag definitions are missing
useful id, class, merge or param attributes. This doesn't impact core
functionality, but it does limit your ability to extend the tags. If
you notice any such omissions, please let us know, it is easy to fix..

## stuff that we really want to do

 * fixup deprecation warnings
 * port to Rails 3.2 and/or 4.0
 * nuke any remaining prototype code
 * add a sane default for non-AJAX JSON requests.
 * trawl the lighthouse && pull requests
 * steal the tags from Portal
 * fixup hobo-contrib

## would be nice:

 * parametrize the clean theme
 * create a bootstrap theme
 * add theme chooser to setup wizard
 * add support for has-one
